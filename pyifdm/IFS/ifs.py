class IFS:
    """
    Represents an Intuitionistic Fuzzy Set (IFS) with membership, non-membership, and uncertainty values.

    Parameters:
    - membership (float): The degree to which an element belongs to the set.
    - non_membership (float): The degree to which an element does not belong to the set.
    - uncertainty (float, optional): The degree of uncertainty in the membership assignment.
      If not provided, it is calculated as 1 - membership - non_membership.

    Methods:
    - __and__(self, other): Intersection operator for IFS.
    - __or__(self, other): Union operator for IFS.
    - __invert__(self): Complement operator for IFS.
    - owa_aggregation(self, weights): Ordered Weighted Averaging (OWA) aggregation operator for IFS.

    Example:
    ```
    # Example Usage:
    ifs1 = IFS(0.6, 0.2)
    ifs2 = IFS(0.8, 0.1)
    intersection_result = ifs1 & ifs2
    union_result = ifs1 | ifs2
    complement_result = ~ifs1
    owa_weights = [0.3, 0.4, 0.3]
    owa_result = ifs1.owa_aggregation(owa_weights)
    ```

    The IFS class supports standard set operations and aggregation, providing a versatile representation
    for handling uncertainty and imprecision in decision-making.
