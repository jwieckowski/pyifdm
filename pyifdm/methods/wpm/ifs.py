        Calculates the alternatives preferences based on Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets

        Parameters
        ----------
            matrix : ndarray
                Decision matrix / alternatives data.
                Alternatives are in rows and Criteria are in columns.

            weights : ndarray
                Vector of criteria weights in a crisp or Intuitionistic Fuzzy form

            types : ndarray
                Types of criteria, 1 profit, -1 cost

            normalization: callable
                Function used to normalize the decision matrix

            distance: callable
                Function used to calculate distance between two IFS

        Returns
        -------
            ndarray
                Crisp preferences of alternatives
